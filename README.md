In our Grocery Management System, we added some new features and fixed issues based on user feedback. In the Products module, we included an Edit button so that existing products can be updated without deleting them, and also created a form to add new Units of Measure (UOMs) like Cubic Meter, which required changes in both backend (Python server) and frontend (UI). In the Orders module, we added form validations so orders cannot be placed with empty customer names, invalid items, or missing quantities. We also fixed a bug in the total calculation, so when the total price of an item is changed, the grand total updates correctly. Finally, we introduced a View button in the orders list, which opens detailed information about the order including items, quantities, prices, and total cost.
